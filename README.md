1. **Create a Gatsby site.**

Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying this project. If you don't have the CLI installed already, see [Gastby instructions](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/#using-the-gatsby-cli).

```sh
gatsby new YOUR-PROJECT-NAME https://github.com/rethc/smooth-brew
```

2. **Start developing.**

Navigate into your new site's directory, install the npm modules, and start the gatsby development server.

```sh
cd YOUR-PROJECT-NAME
npm install
gatsby develop
```

3. **Open the code in your favourite editor and start customizing!**

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

_Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._
